HowToHack85MillonDolarsCompany
==============================

Because to facebook, repeatedly has failed to pay to the researchers for found security flaws, i thinking publish this security flaw if Parse.com or Facebook not negotiate with me, i will have to post this here.

Any app developed with Parse.com can be hacked, this allows check, list, update and delete any data on any table on app involved, this is not hack all databases of the Parse.com, you this security flaw you can ony hack app by app.

I publish here and my youtube account the tutorial about this if none negotiate with my, my discover. 

It was recently purchased by facebook and has a very bad security system, exposes all customers, and anyone stupid kid, can hack this.

This just looking for companies to be serious with its bug bounty programs, as has been repeatedly seen by facebook to not take seriously the security reports made by independent people.

If any guy looking for security problems to report them and correct them, not for the company to not even taken seriously, this is not EXTORTION, this is a precedent for a change aptitude for business.
