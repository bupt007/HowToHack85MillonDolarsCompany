==============================

The security facebook team respond me, is not a security flaw, more guys on the network loved this ...

For facebook security team, is acceptable security risk that any idiot can hack any database developed with Parse.com SDK.

You have to be a idiot, if is "acceptable security risk", that any attacker can list, update and delete any data on their systems.

The behavior you're describing is not a security/privacy risk ??? WTF ??? what think facebook is an risk ???
