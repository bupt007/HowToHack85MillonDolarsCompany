You need in you system is config in debug mode and which is the package that is allowed to use these keys.

If you still do not understand, the backend must add two values more, the package is allowed to run these keys and when debug mode must be enabled.

When writing code, think first of the safety of their customers, its insecure that any package can use them.

The other code, i think you can write (Is not a security risk, yeah right)

Why companies like Facebook and Google have implemented these security policies on their systems, that has not been done in all API's.
